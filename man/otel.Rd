to provide your own tracer from your own package. See

\description{
\pkg{otel} provides tools for integrating with OpenTelemetry, a framework for
observability and tracing in distributed systems.

These methods are intended to enhance the framework to be used with the
\pkg{promises} package, not as a generic replacement.

\item \code{with_ospan_async()}: \ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

Creates an OpenTelemetry span, executes the given expression within it, and
ends the span.

This function is designed to handle both synchronous and asynchronous
(promise-based) operations. For promises, the span is automatically ended
when the promise resolves or rejects.

Returns the result of evaluating \code{expr}. If \code{expr} returns a promise,
the span will be automatically ended when the promise completes.

This function differs from synchronous otel span operations in that it
installs a promise domain and properly handles asynchronous operations. In
addition, the internal span will be ended either when the function exits (for
synchronous operations) or when a returned promise completes (for
asynchronous operations).

If OpenTelemetry is not enabled, the expression will be evaluated without any
tracing context.

\item \code{with_ospan_promise_domain()}: \ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

Adds a handoff "Active OpenTelemetry promise domain" for the expression.

Package authors are required to use this function to have otel span context
persist across asynchronous boundaries. It is important to leverage this
function only once within the execution domain, not recursively / many times.

This method adds a \emph{handoff} "Active OpenTelemetry promise domain" to the
expression evaluation. This \emph{handoff} promise domain will only run once on
reactivation. This is critical if there are many layered \code{with_ospan_async()}
calls, such as within Shiny reactivity. For example, if we nested many
\code{with_ospan_async()} that added a domain which reactivated each ospan on
restore, we'd reactive \code{k} ospan objects (\code{O(k)}) when we only need to
activate the \strong{last} span (\code{O(1)}).

The currently active span (during the call to \code{then()}) will be reactivated
during promise domain restoration.

\item \code{create_ospan()}: \ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

Creates an OpenTelemetry span for discontiguous operations where you need
manual control over when the span ends.

Note, the created span is not activated. Please use \code{\link[=with_ospan_async]{with_ospan_async()}} to
activate it for the supplied expression.

Returns an \pkg{otel} span object.

\item \code{end_ospan()}: \ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

Ends an created OpenTelemetry span for discontiguous operations.
