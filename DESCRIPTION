Description: Provides fundamental abstractions for doing asynchronous
    programming in R using promises. Asynchronous programming is useful
    for allowing a single R process to orchestrate multiple tasks in the
    background while also attending to something else. Semantics are
    similar to 'JavaScript' promises, but with a syntax that is idiomatic
    R.
